Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.


Additionally, I assume I have some payment data. Using each of the main categories as X classes and payment (on time) as Y, I would create a KNN algorithm that looks for nearest neighbors to predict whether a payment given X will be made on time. I would determine k based on how much data is available.
