    "Now that you have some code to create your own populations, sample them, and compare the samples to the populations, it's time to experiment. Using your own Jupyter notebook, or a copy of the notebook from the previous assignment, reproduce the pop1 and pop2 populations and samples, using numpy's binomial function. Specifically, create two binomially distributed populations with n equal to 10 and size equal to 10000. The p-value of pop1 should be 0.2 and the p-value of pop2 should be 0.5. Using a sample size of 100, calculate the means and standard deviations of your samples.\n",
