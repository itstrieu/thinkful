Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

> The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.
    
### Flaws

- The slogans are delivered by different people. 
- It is uncertain that the captured groups are split randomly. 

### Corrections
- Have one person deliver the slogan. If possible, use a pre-recorded message so there are no differences in tone. 
- Ensure that the groups are split randomly. 

> In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

### Flaws
- The groups were not split at random. Jar Jar was sent to planets already known to be friendly, while Windu was sent to unfriendly planets. 

### Corrections
- Send Jar Jar and Windu to two "friendly" and two "unfriendly" planets each. OR send them to the same four planets but allow them to deliver messages to randomly generated subsets of the populations. 

> A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

### Flaws
- HR and IT workers work in different countries, but job satisfaction levels were averaged without taking that into consideration.

### Corrections
- It is possible to average job satisfaction per department per worksite, but perhaps using random selections of the same sample size. This might be better because there are many more HR workers concentrated in three worksites. Otherwise, it may be better to examine only HR and IT from the three worksites where HR is concentrated or even only one worksite where there is plenty of ways to sample randomly.

> When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

### Flaws
- The sample is made of people who have decided to opt in. This is not random. 

### Corrections
- Samples should be random and represent the population. But it may be difficult to receive representative data when it is necessary to have participants' consent. Perhaps it would be better to fill in missing data. 

> To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

### Flaws
- The tests are distributed to groups: A, B, and C, by the order the students arrive. This is not random. For a number of reasons, Group B may be better prepared for the exam. They are not as anxious as Group C nor are they as nonchalant as Group A. 

### Corrections
- Stack the exams such that students receive a randomly assigned exam. The results can be made random by stacking in ABC, ABC order or even more random by ordering each set of three unique examsp by random such as ABC, CBA, BCA, CAB, ABC, BCA, etc. 
- Tests can be pre-assigned to students using a random generator.
