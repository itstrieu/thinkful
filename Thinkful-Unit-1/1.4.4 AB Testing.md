For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

## 1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

### VERSIONS
- Control group: People who continue to sleep without the new supplement.
- Test group: People who begin taking the new supplement before bedtime. 

### SAMPLES
- Both groups should be made of randomly chosen and randomly split adults ages 18-30 (or whatever other age range of interest) who sleep at the same time each day, for the same amount of time, and in the same city.  

### HYPOTHESIS
- I expect the new supplement will (or won't) help people sleep better. 

### OUTCOME
- All participants will wear a sleep monitor that would read and record sleep patterns. It could read and record when participants enter deep sleep. Successfully sleeping better would be determined by participants ability to enter and maintain deep sleep.

### OTHER MEASURABLE VARIABLES
- Partcipants' length of total sleep time could also be measured. 

## 2. Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

### VERSIONS
- Control group: Days when a gym continues to function without implementing new uniforms
- Test group: Days when a gym implements new uniforms 

### SAMPLES
- It's important that data is collected on both groups on the same days of the week. For example, one Monday for a control group and another Monday for the test group. To accomplish this, over the stretch of two weeks or longer, the gym can collect data for every day of the week, twice, or more for each group. The gym can choose to complete an entire week (or two) where uniforms are implemented or spread the days across the two weeks (or month), so long as the test and the control group are applied to each unique day (at least) once. The weeks of experimentation should be weeks without any promotions that would cause any change in business performance. 

### HYPOTHESIS
- I expect the new uniforms will (or won't) help a gym's business. 

### OUTCOME
- Outcome can be measured in terms of gym membership sales. 

### OTHER MEASURABLE VARIABLES
- Equipment sales, daily visitors, and class participation can all be measured. 

## 3. Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

### VERSIONS
- Control group: visitors who have seen no changes to the online business
- Test group: visitors who have seen the new homepage

### SAMPLES
- Because it is not possible to direct visitors to one of two websites that share a domain, it will be necessary to measure data on visitor purchases before switching to the new homepage for two weeks to a month. Then, implement the new homepage immediately and measure the same data for the same amount of time. 

### HYPOTHESIS
- I expect a new homepage will (or won't) improve my online exotic pet rental business.

### OUTCOME
- Outcome can be measured in sales of products.

### OTHER MEASURABLE VARIABLES
- Clicks, visits, and length spent browsing can all be measured. 

## 4. If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

### VERSIONS
- Control group: emails with normal subject lines
- Test group: emails with "please read" in the subject line

### SAMPLES
- Designate a random subset of the mailing list as control and another random subset as test. Send both groups emails at the same time of day. Repeat over different times of days and days of the week. 

### HYPOTHESIS
- I expect putting "please read" in the email subject will (or won't) attract more people to read my emails. 

### OUTCOME
- Outcome can be measured by emails opened. 

### OTHER MEASURABLE VARIABLES
- Clicks from emails
